CS 430 - Computer Graphics
Assignment 03
Timothy Day

Included is the source code for the third assignment detailed on the homework page.

The included makefile does little to nothing as the code is python based, however there is a run target which will run the program with default settings.
Also included, Clean, will clear all the .pyc bytecode files that python generates as well as remove all xpm files from the directory.

The sample postscript files for the homework is also included--Post script is not cleaned by the makefile.

NEW IN ASSIGNMENT 3:
Scan filling
World to Viewport Transformations
Fixed polygon clipping from HW2

To run the program, ./CG_hw3 will run it with default options.  The options for the program are detailed in the assignment:
https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~david/Classes/CS430/HWs/Assignment1.html


CG_hw3: The main python file, the command line parsing is done in here. THIS IS SPECIFIED AS A LINUX EXECUTABLE VIA #!/BIN/BASH AT TOP OF FILE
xpm.py: This is really where the main logic of the program is done, none of the math is here but the xpm file is written and the pixels organized
ps.py: The line clipping and DDA algorithm are in here.  A factory function will be used to read future postcript commands, for now it only recognizes Line.
vectors.py: Implements basic functionality of points and vectors.

The python numpy package is occasionally included though the functionality is never utilized anywhere.  I was working on matrix transformations but opted for the simpler implementation for now.


The program was tested and created by SSHing into tux with x tunneling and viewing xpm with built in display.  All the sample images on the assignment page were working on Tux at the time of submission

The final example, sample D wasn't transforming properly but the scan filling and viewport transformation scaling are working on all examples.
