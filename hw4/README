CS 430 - Computer Graphics
Assignment 04
Timothy Day

Included is the source code for the third assignment detailed on the homework page.

The included makefile does little to nothing as the code is python based, however there is a run target which will run the program with default settings.
Also included, Clean, will clear all the .pyc bytecode files that python generates as well as remove all xpm files from the directory.

NEW IN ASSIGNMENT 4:
Parallel and Perspective 3D Projection
SMF File reading

To run the program, ./CG_hw4 will run it with default options.  The options for the program are detailed in the assignment:
https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~david/Classes/CS430/HWs/Assignment4.html


CG_hw4: The main python file, the command line parsing is done in here. THIS IS SPECIFIED AS A LINUX EXECUTABLE VIA #!/BIN/BASH AT TOP OF FILE
xpm.py: Not changed in assignment 4
smf.py: Handles the reading and assembly of the SMF file and tris/verts.  The main graphics pipeline is in here in the function "TheThirdDimension", a line here can be uncommented to view the transformation matrices
vectors.py: Implements all the logic for the matrices used for the transformation.  Inside the file are several functions for the parallel and perspective transformations

The python numpy package provides dot product and matrix representations

The program was tested and created by SSHing into tux with x tunneling and viewing xpm with built in display.  All the sample images on the assignment page were working on Tux at the time of submission.
