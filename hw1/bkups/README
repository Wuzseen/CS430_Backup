CS 430 - Computer Graphics
Assignment 01
Timothy Day

Included is the source code for the first assignment detailed on the homework page.

The included makefile does little to nothing as the code is python based, however there is a run target which will run the program with default settings.

The sample postscript file for the homework is also included.


To run the program, ./CG_hw1 will run it.  The options for the program are detailed in the assignment:
https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~david/Classes/CS430/HWs/Assignment1.html


CG_hw1: The main python file, the command line parsing is done in here
xpm.py: This is really where the main logic of the program is done, none of the math is here but the xpm file is written and the pixels organized
ps.py: The line clipping and DDA algorithm are in here.  A factory function will be used to read future postcript commands, for now it only recognizes Line.
vectors.py: Implements basic functionality of points and vectors.

The python numpy package is occasionally included though the functionality is never utilized anywhere.  I was working on matrix transformations but opted for the simpler implementation for now.
