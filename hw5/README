CS 430 - Computer Graphics
Assignment 05
Timothy Day

Included is the source code for the fifth assignment detailed on the homework page.

The included makefile does little to nothing as the code is python based, however there is a run target which will run the program with default settings.
Also included, Clean, will clear all the .pyc bytecode files that python generates as well as remove all xpm files from the directory.

NEW IN ASSIGNMENT 4:
Depth Cueing
Z-buffering

To run the program, ./CG_hw5 will run it with default options.  The options for the program are detailed in the assignment:
https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~david/Classes/CS430/HWs/Assignment4.html

# Strictly speaking, python's argparse library does not support options like -1/-2/-3, however they do seem to work on tux.

CG_hw5: The main python file, the command line parsing is done in here. THIS IS SPECIFIED AS A LINUX EXECUTABLE VIA #!/BIN/BASH AT TOP OF FILE
xpm.py: The depth cueing and z-buffering checks take place in here.  Stored in the draw buffer are the color indices ranged 0-19 for the shade which corresponds to the depth.  The z-buffer is stored in a separate data structure
smf.py: This handles the scanfilling and a large part of the z-buffering.
vectors.py: Not changed since assignment 4

The python numpy package provides dot product and matrix representations

The program was tested and created by SSHing into tux with x tunneling and viewing xpm with built in display.  All the sample images on the assignment page were working on Tux at the time of submission.

There are several visual artifacts present due to a bug with the scan filling from the third assignment.  I could not find this bug at the time of submission.  The depth cueing and z-buffering still works however.
